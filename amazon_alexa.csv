Charcoal Fabric ,Love my Echo!,1
Charcoal Fabric ,Loved it!,1
Charcoal Fabric ,"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.",0
Charcoal Fabric ,Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose,0
Charcoal Fabric ,Not much features.,0
Sandstone Fabric ,"Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?",0
Heather Gray Fabric ,Sad joke. Worthless.,0
Charcoal Fabric ,"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.",0
Sandstone Fabric ,It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things,0
Sandstone Fabric ,"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.",0
Charcoal Fabric ,Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password,0
Charcoal Fabric ,Alexa hardly came on..,0
Black,Item no longer works after just 5 months of use. Will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.,0
Black,This thing barely works. You have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box. I'm sending mine back asap. Waste of money.,0
Black,I returned 2 Echo Dots & am only getting refund for 1. I returned 2 in one package. I want my refunds for both of them. They are in the same package. Can you not see them both???!!!,0
Black,not working,0
Black,I'm an Echo fan but this one did not work,0
Black,Doesn't always respond when spoken to with promp word. I thought it would connect to my echo upstairs and use it like an intercom haven't been able to do that.,0
White,It worked for a month or so then it stopped. I've tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working. I want a refund,0
Black,Poor quality. Gave it away.,0
Black,"Never could get it to work. A techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn't strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. So, I am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then.",0
White,"Initially, this echo dot worked very well. Over time, the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling. The other echos/echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot. Would not recommend buying refurbished.",0
Black,"I bought an echo dot that had been refurbished but its stops whatever function its performing quite often, doesn't wake up every time, randomly turns on but does nothing. Do not buy a refurbished Echo dot.",0
Black,Dont trust this....,0
Black,I wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  The speech recognition software is horrible.  My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from the north i am from Texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  We bought two they do the same thing.  Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  Both had problems Switched them around no difference.  So it they are now disconnected dust collectors.,0
Black,Item has never worked. Out of box it is broken. Spent several days trying to get it working and running same &#34;fixes&#34; from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will never order another refurbished device.,0
Black,Great product but returning for new Alexa Dot.  Refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.,0
Black,"&#34;NEVER BUY CERTIFIED AND REFURBISHED ECHO DOT &#34; I bought a &#34;Certified and Refurbished &#34; Echo Dot. This unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. Never buy a refurbished Echo dot. The unit I received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. I also bought a new ECHO dot, it works perfectly.Very disappointed !!!!",0
White,"This item did not work. Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it’s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn’t do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it.",0
White,None,0
Black,Does not work all the time,0
Black,I've already returned it.,0
Black,"Now I'm weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet.",0
Black,"There was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep I spoke with could fix. The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one. No problem with the new one.",0
White,"Two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  No connection, no light, no sound.  I guess I shouldn't have purchased a refurbished Dot.",0
White,Not good at all!,0
Black,"This is the worst Amazon purchase I have made. I am big Amazon fan...love the brand...unlimited digital music...prime videos...even buy my online games, music, and movies through Amazon. This app I have tried to use it make simple purchases -- to do anything. It is useless.",0
Black,The echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12-20 times a day. Do not buy the refurbished product.  2 stars for effort.,0
Black,cant seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure If I will be returning it will try one more time.,0
Black,product stopped working after return time ran out,0
Black,"Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?",0
Black,Bought this for my son and it didn’t work. He had to return it.,0
Black,Bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. Hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.,0
Black,The second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.,0
White,"Very bad this device, I don’t know if it’s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded",0
Black,So far not impressed at all. Does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time I'm not sure what the excitement is all about. Alexas voice sounds like it's under water how am I supposed to understand!!!!I'm going to return and try a google home!!!,0
Black,"great product, but useless overall. Too many unnecessary features. Unless you have a smart home you don't need it",0
White,I cant figure out how to use it.,0
Black,It doesn’t always  work,0
Black,All the new Amazon products I have are great everything I bought refurbished is complete garbage. I will never purchase Amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction,0
White,Extremely low in volume,0
White,"Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong.",0
Black,"If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I’ve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??",0
White,Eh. It’s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine,0
White,"I wanted a white dot for my white bathroom.  The top is black as shown, which I knew, but I did not realize the cord and plug were also black. I wanted a white cord and plug.",0
Black,I set up the Echo Dot and it worked for an hour and then died completely. DO NOT BUY refurbished!!!! I sent back for return the day after I received.,0
Black,This Echo Dot is horrible. The volume on my phone is louder than than this device. My boss has one at this is not the case,0
White,It's ok. The speaker is pretty terrible. Google home is a better product.,0
White,The first one quit working shortly after I got it. The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.,0
White,Device was not working. Followed all instructions for Alexa echo dot and it did not come on. Very upsetting.,0
Black,Sent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on - but what can you expect with a refurbished item?,0

Black  Spot,Honestly I like it but at the same time I don’t I could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half I bought it for the video chat and I have never really used it,0
Black  Spot,It is very slow compared to the echo,0
Black  Spot,"As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn't go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can't turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful.",0
White  Spot,I returnef this item because it does not speak Spanish,0
Black  Spot,"When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  If you want to make sure you are protected and don't allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe.",0
White  Spot,After only a couple of days Alexa did not answer. I have disconnected and will see if it does any better after reconnecting.,0
Black  Spot,I wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom.  But the font is too small to see from any distance.  And apparently you can't change it.,0
Black  Spot,Meh,0
White  Spot,"This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it's an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time. Have rebooted the device, re-set, etc etc.Until these two obvious software issues are fixed, in my opinion the product is useless.",0
Black  Spot,You need a Harvard law degree to operate this thing! It's going back very soon!,0
Black  Spot,product turns on randomly and sometimes at night,0
Black  Spot,I would love this but there is no way to stop the screen from constantly scrolling through “things to try”. If Amazon would make this a setting I would change my review to 5 stars.,0
White  Spot,I haven't figured out how to make or receive calls.  Device tells me I need to register and I do not know what to do.,0
Black  Spot,"Great product and I would give 5 stars - but you can't scroll face cards without having the stupid &#34;try and ask Alexa&#34; suggestions pop up.  Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating.  I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot.  What a dumb move on Amazons_ part.",0
White  Spot,"This product is a complete waste of money. When you ask Alexa a question ""she"" either doesn't know the answer, gives you the wrong answer or finds information off of Wikipedia!",0
White  Spot,"Honestly it's no different from the Echo dots I already own,  other then occasionally seeing the lyrics to a song I'm listening too i really don't see the difference.",0
Black  Spot,"I switched to google. The amazon helper is more for shopping, and google is the tasks assistant.",0
Black  Spot,ALEXA IS NOT AS SMART AS SIRI! CANNOT CANCEL SNOOZE AFTER ALARM GOES OFF. HAVE TO CANCEL PRE-SET ALARM FOR WEEKDAYS.,0
White  Spot,"Great product EXCEPT there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time PERMANENTLY.  When in 'Clock' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'Things to Try' screen.  I intended on buying several units for my house, but I do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me.  Acting as clock should be a BASIC feature of the Echo Spot.  How could you get this wrong, Amazon??  #FAIL",0
Black  Spot,"I wanted to use this as a bedside clock with the ability to play music and podcasts. Sadly, it continuously scrolls the &#34;Things to try&#34; and won't stay on the clock face. Amazon is about to get this one back.",0
White  Spot,Not happy with the Spot.  Reset numerous times.  Seems to be in slow mode.  Have to be practically on top of it for it to hear me.  Even after talking with support I still do not have “themes” in the menu to choose from!,0
White  Spot,"All is fine with the Spot exact for one massive failing.  In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made.",0
Black  Spot,"item returned for repair ,receivded item back from repair 07/23/18 . parts missing no power cord included.please advise",0
Black  Spot,"For as awesome as the Echo and Echo Dots are, the Spot is a disappointment. There is very little control over what the screen shows, what the clock looks like, what order things show up in, etc. At this point if I hadn't thrown the box away immediately, I would have sent it back and just got another full size Echo.",0
Black  Spot,Product forces user to review Alexa Things to Try. There is no way to disable it.,0
Black  Spot,"Can’t be used as a baby monitor which is why I had purchased it.  I didn’t realize this until I read the reviews on the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam.  Considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix, surprised Amazon hasn’t upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the Nest app.",0
Black  Spot,"I own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i’m debating whether to return all 3 devices.  My wife says we should.",0
Black  Spot,Disconnects often,0
Black  Spot,Get rid of the &#34;Thongs To Try&#34; screen!!!!!!!!!! Numb nuts!!!!!,0
Black  Spot,The echo works fine but then you get indundated with &#34;Things to try&#34;. I am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things. I found there is no way to turn this off except for .... turning off the screen. If I cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back.,0
Black  Spot,Can't turn of &#34;things to try&#34; on the screen scroll. This  is a big promotion device for Amazon.  Packing it up and sending it back.  They really want to get in our heads.  Enough already.,0
Black  Spot,This thing woke me up in the middle of the night saying “ready for setup”. It was already setup. Should be a simple thing to check  time before asking. Wife not happy...,0
Black  Spot,"The product is attractive and somewhat useful, BUT, Amazon chose to force users to view their “things to try” and Trending”.  This greatly depreciates the value of the product.  Do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from Amazon.",0
Black  Spot,"It's not as good as Siri, BUT it still has some positives, it's great at playing music, and setting alarms. I personally felt that I paid too much for this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day (literally the day after I purchased it). So I'm pretty disappointed. I might still return it and get my money back. .",0
Black  Spot,Fairly useless.,0
Black  Spot,Bought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working—called and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable—expected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.,0
Black  Spot,For the size of the screen this thing should be $25,0
Black  Spot,Invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to! CREAPY AF,0
Black  Spot,"I love the product , but very disappointed once I  realized I can no longer play youtube videos.  I'm now past my 30 days return date.  I am realizing I now have an expensive alarm clock.  I am hoping youtube comes back.  I was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day. Glad I didn't.",0
Black  Show,Waste of money over the echo generation 2.  You don’t really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do I have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution.  I have also had problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices.  Price difference is just not worth it,0
Black  Show,No you tube wouldn't have bought it if I known that,0
White  Show,"Don't waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn't add much.  I can't see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I'm surprised Amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.",0
Black  Show,Thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.,0
White  Show,"Do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either.  It rarely gets what I say correct, does not control the Dish receiver.  Yes I set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone.  We got this for 129,  which is a good deal, ti is definately not worth the 229 price though.  Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb.  Really can not recommend this item at the current time",0
White  Show,Very disappointed.  Alexa doesn’t hear me and doesn’t respond to my requests.,0
Black  Show,I have been through 4 Shows now.  And ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN BROKEN.  It has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders.  I don't have these issues on my Dot or my Echo.  Just on the Show.  It would be nice if Amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing.,0
White  Show,"Alexa is pretty dumb ,,,",0
Black  Show,Fire HD does so much more.  Over priced pair of speakers.,0
Black  Show,"Very intrusive, so I turn it off",0
Black  Show,"It's like having another kid in the house; I have to constantly repeat myself.I can tell Alexa to do something clear as day, and according to the history, she hears something comeletely different.The device is really cool, and I like the concept, which is why it gets two stars. However, it just doesn't work as intended.I find myself irritated more often than not when I use this device.",0
Black  Show,The way the music sounds is poor quality,0
Black  Show,All of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with Sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account. Asking any echo device to play music on Sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. This went on for two weeks until I eventually solved the problem that neither Amazon nor Sonos could figure out.,0
Black  Show,It f****** sucks,0
White  Show,"Always wanted one,till I got one, it's not at all what it's cracked up to be, it's hard to navigate I actually like the dot better.",0
Black  Show,"Echo Show is said to work with certain apps but,NOT!!! Cozi state works with Echo Show, but the Cozi Family’s doesn’t very well, Amazon needs to go back to drawing board, it would be such a needed piece of technology, but it lacks the essential, please fix. Cost of the Echo Show was  marvelous . Got Echo Show to take on shopping list but that is all so far, adding items to list has long lag, and it not my router being slow, my provider speed is !GB, speed not a problem, but before new items is updated on Cozi is very slow. Help is needed to get it updated to A1 working conditioning.",0
Black  Show,"Disappointed that this device Is not able to access youtube as of Dec 2017. I wasn’t aware of that when I purchased it. I’ve had problems with my device. The voice stops working throughout the day. I can see it trying to respond to me, because the window it opens contains the info I asked about, but it’s like the device gets stuck in the process. It stops working, and the blue bar just flashes. I keep having to unplug and restart the device. Once I do that, it starts working again. So irritating. This device could really be a great device if Google and Amazon would act like grownups...",0
Black  Show,Returned from repair with No repair done. It has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itself.I sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed.  The site gives no option to complain from the page.I have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position.,0
Black  Show,"Great device, features are awesome, the interaction is fantastic. Home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly. My only issue is out of (4) Echo Shows (2) of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching!! These are less than 3 months old and already having issues!First repairs were sent off and they “updated the firmware” when I got the device back nothing worked, I had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again. Then (2) weeks later the glitch starts up again!I love the show but I’m getting really frustrated with the glitching.",0
Black  Show,"I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could.",0
White  Show,"Our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full-fledged tablet.  What fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio books, etc. However, once we have them setup, we discovered the huge lurking negative.  Amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their Alexa features.  You can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off &#34;Things to Try&#34;.  Instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time ... we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says, &#34;Try ......&#34;.  AMAZON, please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this SPAM!",0
White  Show,No YouTube,0
White  Show,"Works fine, I just realize I don’t need this because I don’t use it.",0
Black  Show,Need to be able to connect to more 3rd party viceo apps,0
White  Show,The tech isn’t there. It doesn’t understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio,0
White  Show,The sound on these is terrible. It’s like a tin can. I love my echo but this item is awful.,0
Black  Show,"This was my 4th echo device, 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential, and I really wanted to like it, but soon found out it is quite limited. A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.",0
Black  Plus,Alexa didn’t know answers to many questions we asked. For example we asked how many cups in a pound and she said a pound is a form of money,0
Black  Plus,"I decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the Echo Plus to control it.  I chose a Kwikset 888 because Amazon said it was compatible and I bought 2 Dots while I was at it.  And when I posed the question, somebody in the community said it will work with Alexa.  What I didn't know was the Z-wave lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren't compatible.  Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus?  If not, I guess my choices are: 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink.  2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else.I  don't want to just buy another hub to use along side my Echo Plus or I'll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because I was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn't work.",0
Black  Plus,no habla espanol,0
Black  Plus,no it is broke and I can't get help fixing or replacing it,0
Black  Plus,"I’m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine.",0
White  Plus,Terrible. Stopped working after one day.,0
White  Plus,"It does not speak in Spanish,,,I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when I’m not around,,,,,no Spanish!",0
Black  Plus,"When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn't realize and also wasn't fully communicated to me, is that you can't use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I'm only disappointed with the hub's functionalities.",0
Black  Plus,"I am so disappointed in this product.  I tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed.  Hours with Amazon technicians.. resetting each of them.  The app didn't connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection.  Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck.  There are no clean directions on the application.  Probably sending this back to Amazon..mark this as Not ready for prime time.",0
White  Plus,The alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work. I was not aware of that.  Disappointed,0
Black  Plus,wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.,0
Black  Plus,"It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it's fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you.",0
Black  Plus,The echo part works fine.  The hue hub is a disaster.  It worked for a few months and then nothing.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair.  I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.  I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful.  Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.,0
Black  Plus,It was supposed to come with a free Hue lightbulb on Amazon Prime Day.  No light bulb arrived.  False advertising!,0
Black  Plus,Haven't had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. Tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. It will be on it's way back to Amazon,0
Black  Plus,"I'll be returning it.  It's been nothing but annoying.  The hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can't even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't.  I found that rather interesting.",0
Black  Plus,The Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would. I have spent multiple hours on this. Made phone calls and texts. Also is missing free bulb.,0
Black  Plus,Doesn't use apple music.  It is worthless to me without it.  Sound quality on it is also poor.,0
Black  Plus,"I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked.",0
Black  Plus,I am not tec smart enough to make it work at all. Will send it back if I cant get help. My eco dot works just fine. this is too complacated.I just wanted a bigger speaker.,0
Black  Plus,Product does not.  Light bar never went orange.  I googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions. I tried both.  Product is defective,0
Black  Plus,"I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.",0
Black  Plus,received the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. Thank you Amazon.,0
White  Plus,"Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won't even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What's the point of having a hub that doesn't support half the devices out there?  DON'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won't work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.  They actually understand you when you talk.",0
Black  Plus,"I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I’ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.",0
White  Plus,"At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I'd understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.",0
Black  Plus,I bought this for myself and i didn’t realize it had to be plugged in just to work. It isn’t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall. It should’ve been more clear when i bought it.,0
Black  Plus,"I would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone (Galaxy S8), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won't call me I'll tell em to send the product back!",0
Black  Plus,"Unit came with the wrong plug, will have to send back to Amazon.",0
White  Plus,"The sound quality is not that good, especially for the price that you pay for this. I would recommend to get the Echo Dot and buy a better speaker instead. Maybe Sonos and use the Echo dot.",0
White  Plus,"I will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible. With my lifetime Amazon spending approaching nearly $40,000, I’m sure I’m just a small customer to them, but I’ve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of Amazon purchases.I have 8+ echos for home automation and bought this Echo Plus specifically for the built-in hub along with approximately $600+ in zigbee light switches. The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the Amazon/Zigbee ecosystem. If you value your money, and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere",0
Black  Plus,Didn’t really work as smooth as they make it seem like.,0
Black  Plus,"As an echo its great, Good sound quality and functionality. As a smart home hub, it sucks. No automation, no geo-fencing, no music syncing for hue, no z-wave. All it does is turn things on with your voice. Ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over.",0
Black  Plus,"Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It’s far from being useful.Half the time when you “wake” the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn’t hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It’s been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I’m past the return period...... zzzz",0

Configuration: Fire TV Stick,I will never buy anything Amazon makes again!This fire stick is not even a year old and it does nothing but restart and freeze up constantly. No warranty from Amazon in this should have been my first clue that it was a horrible device. I will never buy anything built by Amazon again.,0
Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Was loving it but starting in June Hulu stopped working and crunchyroll doesn’t work either. Probably will switch to something else soon.,0

Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Ease of usage,1
Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"I love this, it's quick and easy to use. I love that there are so many apps you can access but disappointed some of them cost extra money to use. I also love the music app on here. I didn't think I would use it because I have Alexa echo and listen to music all the time on there. But I tried it on the fire tv and it gives you the lyric as the songs play! Love it!!",1
Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Love it. The only downside is that you can't download any app you want.,1
Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"I’m very unhappy with this Firestick, every time we change programs or channels within a program there is a very long delay. We have 2 Roku’s That work just fine and are very quick.",0
Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"Had to return it as Hulu does not work on device.  It kept coming up with errors, and Hulu app not being able to open at times.  It was hit and miss, and at times, Hulu will stop working right in the middle of a show or movie.  Plus fire stick is very slow in opening the apps.",0
Configuration: Fire TV Stick,The Firestick we were sent doesn’t work. At all.  Voice remote won’t even turn on. We did all the troubleshooting steps. Didn’t work. Contacted Amazon. They sent us a new one - with no remote/no way to control it! We gave up and got a Roku (which works great!),0

I purchased on Prime Day plus I used rewards to pay for it, so in the end I paid next to nothing. If I had paid full price for it I might want my money back. We stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device. I know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from.",0

Configuration: Fire TV Stick,I would not recommend this to anyone. It won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru. It tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time. Try again later.  It is not the Netflix site cause I can stream it just fine on my computer.  Its the Firestick. very disappointing.,0

Black  Dot,"I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!",0
Black  Dot,Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.,0
Black  Dot,"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.",0
Black  Dot,I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.,0
Black  Dot,The volume is very low,0
Black  Dot,Cheap and cheap sound.,0
Black  Dot,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.",0
White  Dot,Used twice not working!!!!!!!,0
Black  Dot,This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!,0
White  Dot,Not all that happy. The speaker isn’t great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better,0
Black  Dot,"When you think about it this really doesn’t do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock.",0
Black  Dot,"This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace.",0
Black  Dot,Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically.,0
Black  Dot,"Love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun.",1
Black  Dot,Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!,1
White  Dot,I love it! I use it for everything. It’s a part of my daily routine,1
Black  Dot,"The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder.",1
White  Dot,Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don’t have a “smart home” and don’t intend to make it one. But it’s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.,1
Black  Dot,Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.,1
White  Dot,Set up is so easy.,1
Black  Dot,Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.,0
White  Dot,I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.,0
Black  Dot,"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.",0
Black  Dot,Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.,0
Black  Dot,Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.,0
White  Dot,NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(,0
Black  Dot,The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.,0
Black  Dot,I didn’t order it,0
White  Dot,The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.,0
White  Dot,"Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it’s great that I was able to set that as default. There’s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It’s a must have!",1
Black  Dot,Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.,1
Black  Dot,This  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I'm seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it's the next best thing to the internet  :-*,1
Black  Dot,I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself,1
Black  Dot,It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.,1
Black  Dot,I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.,1
Black  Dot,Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom,1
Black  Dot,"excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns",1
Black  Dot,It's pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn't understand my commands some of the time.,1
Black  Dot,I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.,1
Black  Dot,I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.,1
Black  Dot,"Love my Alexa! Actually have 3 throughout the house. Favorite function is lists. Great for time management and if course, music.",1
Black  Dot,This product is easy to use and very entertaining.  I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.,1
Black  Dot,works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.,1
White  Dot,Outstanding product - easy to use.  works great,1
White  Dot,We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.,1
Black  Dot,Use the product for music and it’s great!,1
Black  Dot,Easy to set-up and to use.,1
Black  Dot,It works great!!,1
White  Dot,I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.,1

Black  Dot,"Perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!",1
Black  Dot,"Listening to music, searching locations, checking time, looking up weather. There are many more task to learn. It was simple to set up.",1
Black  Dot,"I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems.",1
White  Dot,"Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers.",1
Black  Dot,Good,1
Black  Dot,Nice little unit  no issues,1
Black  Dot,"The echo dot was easy to set up and use. It helps provide music, etc. to small spaces and was just what I was looking for.",1
Black  Dot,"I set her up to play through our home theater system. So fat we are just using her for weather forecasts, cooking timers, and we really enjoy the music!",1
White  Dot,Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive,1
Black  Dot,beyond awesome,1
Black  Dot,I like that it responds every time. It was easy to set up.  I'm still learning what I can do with it. I may like a better speaker more.,1
Black  Dot,Family loved it!,1
Black  Dot,I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.,1
Black  Dot,Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.,1

I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office.",1

Black  Dot,Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.,1
Black  Dot,I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!,1
Black  Dot,I got this for dad on father's Day!  He was tickled with it!,1
White  Dot,Nice product,1
Black  Dot,Love my echo. Love playing music in my room,1
Black  Dot,"Still getting used to Alexa, but I think she's a keeper!",1
White  Dot,Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn’t know. I thought she was supposed to know everything,1
Black  Dot,my new best friend :),1
Black  Dot,Absolutely love it!!!!,1
Black  Dot,I liked linking two more rooms in the home,1
Black  Dot,I LOVE ALEXA!! SHE ROCKS!!!,1
Black  Dot,"I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.",1
Black  Dot,Small size works great in our sunroom.,1
White  Dot,I like it and it’s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.,1
Black  Dot,"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.",0
Black  Dot,"It won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work",1
Black  Dot,"I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa",1
Black  Dot,"This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home.",1
Black  Dot,Great product at a great price.,1
Black  Dot,My son loves his Echo Dot.,1
Black  Dot,Love these.  Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.,1
White  Dot,I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.,1
White  Dot,It plays music that I request.,1
Black  Dot,I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.,0
Black  Dot,Luv it.  It's a great product.,1
Black  Dot,"What can I say. Well, I’m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.",1
White  Dot,Great product,1
Black  Dot,"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.",1
Black  Dot,"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.",1
Black  Dot,"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol",1
White  Dot,"Alarm,bed time story, universal",1
Black  Dot,I am in love with alexa,1
Black  Dot,Its was easy to set up,1
Black  Dot,Works better than anticipated. This thing is awesome.,1
Black  Dot,Great product,1
Black  Dot,Really like it,1
White  Dot,I like that it respond most of my comands. Great product.,1
Black  Dot,The volume is very low,0
White  Dot,so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity,1
Black  Dot,"My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!",1
Black  Dot,Wish volume was capable of going louder,1
Black  Dot,I love it,1
White  Dot,Best purchase this year.,1
Black  Dot,"I love these, I have 2 dots and one echo. For a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although I do use external for the dots.",1
Black  Dot,I really love my dots! So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%,1
Black  Dot,its okay but keeps dropping wifi!,1
Black  Dot,Kids love it! I love it!,1
Black  Dot,Love my echo dot easy to use and set up,1
Black  Dot,love it as I do all of my echos,1
Black  Dot,Excellent product !!,1
Black  Dot,"I love being able to control lights, doors and music.",1
Black  Dot,Fun To interact with,1
Black  Dot,Very satisfied with the product,1
Black  Dot,"We have 3 echos now, even one in the barn, great idea for when I am working with my horse, can still get news flashes & my music!",1
Black  Dot,"I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too.",1
Black  Dot,Like having the music where ever I am.,1
White  Dot,"Hard to hear, had to blue tooth it to a better speaker.",1
Black  Dot,"No problems, works as expected. Could have a better speaker.",1
Black  Dot,I love it...... I want to get another one very  very  soon,1
White  Dot,Great to have along with the Echo,1
Black  Dot,this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to.  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker.  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot.  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered.,1
White  Dot,"daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet.",1
Black  Dot,Cheap and cheap sound.,0
Black  Dot,This is pretty cool,1
Black  Dot,"Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!",1
Black  Dot,Love it!! Don’t know what took me so long to get one — and don’t know why I didn’t get two on Amazon Prime Day!,1
Black  Dot,Up dated news,1
Black  Dot,Works like a champ.,1
Black  Dot,"Clear sound, great alarm clock, plays my music.  What else can you ask for.  Oh yeah, you can order what you need.",1
White  Dot,Love that you can use your cell phone to call Echo or Dot. You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.,1
Black  Dot,love it...just like the other 4 I own.,1
White  Dot,"Great price.  I love my echo dot,",1
Black  Dot,Excellent. Bought another one yesterday!,1
Black  Dot,works great,1
White  Dot,Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha,1
Black  Dot,"Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!",1
Black  Dot,Just got my third one. Love them,1
Black  Dot,The ease in installing,1
Black  Dot,"Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet.",1
Black  Dot,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.",0
Black  Dot,"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item.",1
White  Dot,Love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!,1
Black  Dot,"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.",1
Black  Dot,"Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.",1
Black  Dot,It does everything  the big guy does,1
Black  Dot,Great product - understands my accent!,1
Black  Dot,Love it... can't stop using it..,1
White  Dot,Really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.,1
White  Dot,"very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps.",1
Black  Dot,Cool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!,1
Black  Dot,It is s great tool helping with information.,1
White  Dot,Used twice not working!!!!!!!,0
Black  Dot,Awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. Great purchase.,1
Black  Dot,"I jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an Echo.  I feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later, the device is sharing news and weather.  Now we use it some, but have not tapped in to all options.  Still testing it out.",1
White  Dot,Love Alexa. Love the Echo Dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.,1
White  Dot,"Love it , Now if I can only find the correct smart (links)Plug to connect this too",1
White  Dot,Work pretty well,1
Black  Dot,Still learning it,1
White  Dot,"We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of.",1
Black  Dot,Usual reliable Alexa,1
Black  Dot,Speaker could be better qualty,1
Black  Dot,This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!,0
Black  Dot,Have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great,1
Black  Dot,"Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one.",1
Black  Dot,Very pleased,1
Black  Dot,Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.,1
Black  Dot,Nice,1
Black  Dot,"Music, weather, time.",1
Black  Dot,"Great, love it!",1
White  Dot,Not all that happy. The speaker isn’t great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better,0
Black  Dot,Not impressed,1
Black  Dot,I really like it .,1
White  Dot,it takes a while to learn the uses and I'm still learning!,1
Black  Dot,Alexa is phenomenal!,1
Black  Dot,"When you think about it this really doesn’t do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock.",0
Black  Dot,"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.",1
Black  Dot,I use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker. It works great for what I need.,1
White  Dot,I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.,1
Black  Dot,"Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such.",1
Black  Dot,"Great product, fun to use!!",1
Black  Dot,Needs to be smarter,1
Black  Dot,I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...,1
Black  Dot,Love it. Works great making my home a smarthome,1
White  Dot,I really like the echo dot. It’s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.,1
White  Dot,Convenient and fun.,1
White  Dot,It's alright....,1
Black  Dot,this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!,1
Black  Dot,"I love searching the Alexa skill shop on the app. Useful things like having Alexa turn my lights on and off, listening to news updates every morning. And fun stuff like telling Alexa to make the Star Trek red alert nois. Or playing song quiz with friends.",1
Black  Dot,Second dot.,1
Black  Dot,Son loves it.,1
Black  Dot,I love how compact it is.,1
Black  Dot,"This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace.",0
Black  Dot,"It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to.",1
Black  Dot,Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically.,0
Black  Dot,"Love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun.",1
Black  Dot,Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!,1
White  Dot,I love it! I use it for everything. It’s a part of my daily routine,1
Black  Dot,"The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder.",1
White  Dot,Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don’t have a “smart home” and don’t intend to make it one. But it’s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.,1
Black  Dot,Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.,1
White  Dot,Set up is so easy.,1
Black  Dot,Love it,1
Black  Dot,I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.,1
White  Dot,I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.,1
Black  Dot,"Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!",1
White  Dot,"I'm finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!",1
White  Dot,I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????,1
Black  Dot,Gave as a gift - they loved it.,1
Black  Dot,The Echo Dot was everything that I expected and more.,1
Black  Dot,I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier,1
White  Dot,"I love my echo dot. Has many features and works great.The only thing I don't like about it, is that I can't play my iMusic on it. I'm going to have to pay for a Spotify or Amazon music account.",1
White  Dot,Its Great. Lots Of Fun!!,1
White  Dot,"Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,",1
White  Dot,Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.,1
Black  Dot,I like the compact structure of the Dot. The sound is a little too low.,1
White  Dot,"Handy if you don't expect much out of it much ""dumber"" than the assistant in my phone.",1
Black  Dot,It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.,1
White  Dot,Love the product but dislike that I can’t sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play,1
Black  Dot,Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.,1
Black  Dot,love it,1
Black  Dot,Works like a charm.,1
Black  Dot,Good speaker for bedroom or office,1
Black  Dot,Small speaker tin sound. Great with good Bluetooth speaker.,1
White  Dot,Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!,1
Black  Dot,It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!,1
White  Dot,I love that I can shut the microphone off at night so my children can’t talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. Not sure how I survived with out this for so long.,1
Black  Dot,Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.,1
Black  Dot,"The sound quality wasn’t great, but it was inexpensive",1
Black  Dot,Works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.,1
Black  Dot,It isn’t bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it’s not bad for the sale price I paid.,1
Black  Dot,It’s great but sound quality is very low,1
White  Dot,I love it.,1
Black  Dot,"As Always, easy to set up",1
Black  Dot,It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.,1
Black  Dot,"Very intelligent, love the songs ....",1
White  Dot,Review,1
Black  Dot,"I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.",1
Black  Dot,Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.,0
Black  Dot,Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.,1
White  Dot,"I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill.",1
Black  Dot,The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I'm asking for.,1
White  Dot,HANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND,1
White  Dot,I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.,0
Black  Dot,"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed.",1
Black  Dot,Totally gets out sense of humour,1
Black  Dot,We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.,1
Black  Dot,"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!",1
Black  Dot,LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.,1
White  Dot,Better sound.,1
Black  Dot,"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound.",1
Black  Dot,"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.",0
Black  Dot,"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!",1
White  Dot,"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.",1
Black  Dot,"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.",1
Black  Dot,Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker,1
Black  Dot,Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. __ Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.,1
Black  Dot,small footprint.  nice clarity.,1
White  Dot,Easy set up,1
Black  Dot,Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.,0
Black  Dot,Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.,0
White  Dot,NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(,0
Black  Dot,The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.,0
Black  Dot,I didn’t order it,0
White  Dot,The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.,0
